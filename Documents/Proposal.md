# Description:
Weather forecasting is most challenging problem around the world. There are various reason because of its experimented values in meteorology, but it is also a typical unbiased time series forecasting problem . The motive behind research is to predict the temperature and weather in Makkah city .This project contribute the same using artificial neural network (ANN) 
# Data Description:

The data that will be used in this project has been downloaded from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/esraamadi/saudi-arabia-weather-history It contains a set 249023 rows Ã— 15 columns , Describes the Kingdom's climate throughout the year and temperature changes in a number of regions of the Kingdom , We selected the Makkah region

# Algorithm:

We will apply feature selection and extraction to extract the most important features from the weather file and then we will apply neural network algorithms.


# Goal:

he goal of this project is: Dealing with time series to predict temperatures and weather and use of deep learning algorithms .

# Tools:

*	Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
*	Sklearn-Scikit-learn for modeling.
*	Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
*	tensorflow
*	Keras
